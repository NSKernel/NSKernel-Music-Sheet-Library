# NSKernel's Music Sheets Library

## What's Inside

Inside this repository are the music sheets (either rearranged or transcribed) created and typesetted by me. My personal flavour ranged from games to animations. I've been a chorus conductor during my undergraduate years and I play pianos and digital keyboards which all give you a hint on what to expect.

## Contribute

You will get a PDF copy because I use Sibelius with my own selection of fonts so releasing the `.sib` will probably not work on your side thus you will not find them. To ask for a bug fix, just open an issue and I will take a look.

This repository works as a personal archive so I am not taking new arrangements from your contribution.

## Usage and License

The sheets are provided as is. You are granted the permission to copy, distribute and perform as long as the mention of the credits of me. You may, however, need to see if local copyright laws require a license from the original artists of the music you choose. As a general situation though, most countries do not require any license if your performance is private and not involving with money.
